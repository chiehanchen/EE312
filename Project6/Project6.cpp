/*
 * the two dimensional array maze[MATRIX_SIZE][MATRIX_SIZE] contains a maze
 * Each square is (initially) either a 1 or a zero.  Each 1 represents a wall
 * (you cannot walk through walls, so you can't go into any square where the
 * value is 1).  Each 0 represents an open space.
 *
 * Write an recursive solution to find your way out of the maze
 * Your starting point is at row and col. (params to this function)
 * Your exit point is somewhere in the last row (which is: MATRIX_SIZE - 1)
 *
 * There is a relatively easy recursive solution to this problem, the trick is
 * to think of the solution in the following terms:
 *   "In which direction(s) can I go and find a way out of this maze?"
 * In some cases, you may find yourself in a spot in the maze that there's
 * no way out (at least, not without backtracking). In that case, you'd return "false"
 * since the maze has no solution. In most cases, there's one or more ways out
 * from where you are now. Your key question is simply, "what is the first step I need to take"
 *
 * If you considered going "north", and you had a function that could tell you whether
 * it was possible to get out of the maze starting at the square to the north of your
 * current position, then you could use this function to determine if you can get out by
 * going north first. Similarly, you could consider going south, east or west, and (recursively)
 * determine if the maze can be solved from any of those locations.
 *
 * With that hint, the base case should be pretty obvious.  In fact,
 * I'd suggest you consider the possibility that the base case is "Yup, I'm already at
 * the exit!"
 *
 * There is one tricky part to this decomposition.  You need to make certain
 * that the problem is getting smaller.  The "bigness" or "smallness" of this
 * problem is the number of squares that have not yet been tested.  Each time
 * you test an adjacent square (making a recursive call to decide if there is a
 * path to the exit through that square), you'll be reducing  the number of squares
 * that have not yet been tested.  Eventually, you must have tested all the
 * squares and so you'll have to have found a way to the exit.
 *
 * The easy way to deal with the tricky part is to leave "bread crumbs" behind.
 * Before you recursively check any (or all) of your neighbors to see if you
 * can find the exit from there -- drop a bread crumb in your current square.
 * Then, don't ever check to see if you can find the exit using a square
 * with a breadcrumb in it (backtracking into that square would be silly).
 *
 * If you're trying to see if you can find an exit from some square, and all
 * the adjacent squares are either walls, or have bread crumbs in them, then
 * you already know the answer -- "you can't get to the exit from here".
 * Pick up your bread crumb and return false.
 *
 * You can set the value of the current square to "2" to indicate that a bread
 * crumb has been dropped.  Set the square back to 0 when you want to pick
 * the bread crumb back up.
 * be sure not to change any of the squares that are 1 (the walls).
 *
 * for partial credit, you can leave all your bread crumbs on the floor.
 * for full credit, you must pick up all the bread crumbs EXCEPT those
 * along a path to the exit.

 * the two dimensional array maze[MATRIX_SIZE][MATRIX_SIZE] contains a maze
 * Each square is (initially) either a 1 or a zero.  Each 1 represents a wall
 * (you cannot walk through walls, so you can't go into any square where the value
 * is 1).  Each 0 represents an open space.
 *
 * write an iterative solution to find your way out of the maze
 * Your starting point is at row and col. (params to this function)
 * Your exit point is somewhere in the last row (which is: MATRIX_SIZE - 1)
 * The maze can be solved by following the right hand wall.  In fact, there
 * is exactly one path between any two points in the maze (well, between any two
 * points that are not walls).
 *
 * The algorithm is not too bad, although it is certainly not trivial
 * Initially, you'll be headed DOWN (direction 2)
 * Each iteration do one of the following.  Note that only one of two cases
 * can possibly apply (the properties of the maze guarantee that).
 *    case 1: you can move in the current direction
 *       In this case, you should take one step in the current direction
 *       and then turn right.
 *    case 2: you cannot move in the current direction
 *       If there's a wall directly in front of you, then to follow the right
 *       hand wall, you'd need to turn left (placing your hand on the wall that
 *       used to be directly in front of you).  So, if you discover this case
 *       then turn left.  Don't move, just turn left.
 * If you were walking down a straight corridor (with walls on both sides)
 * then you'd alternate case 1 and case 2.  On the first iteration, you'd
 * take a step, and then turn right (case 1).  This causes you to walk
 * one position down the hallway but then turn to face the wall.
 * On the next iteration, you'll be facing the wall, so you can't walk
 * forward and therefore (case 2) you'll turn left.  On the third iteration
 * you'll be able to walk down the hallway again.
 *
 * If you follow those two cases, then you'll eventually find your way out
 * of the maze.  To confirm that you're making it out, leave a "bread crumb"
 * behind each square along the path to the exit.
 * For partial credit, place a bread crumb in every square you visit.
 * For full credit, pick up all the breadcrumbs when you backtrack.
 * Backtracking is when you go back to a square you've already been before.
 * If the square you're about to step into has a breadcrumb, then pick up
 * the bread crumb in the square you're at now.
 * You indicate "bread crumbs" by setting the square equal to "2"
